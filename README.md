# String Case Swapper

## Description
This script takes a user-entered string as input and swaps the case of each character. Uppercase characters are converted to lowercase, and vice versa.

## Project Setup
This function takes user input as a string and flips the case of each character. It leverages the readline module to interact with the user and the map function to iterate through characters. Uppercase letters are converted to lowercase, and vice versa. The modified characters are then joined back into a single string with the swapped cases.



# Range Generator

## Description
This code prompts the user for two numbers and generates an array containing all integers between those numbers (inclusive). The script utilizes the `readline` module to interact with the user and a `for` loop to construct the array.

## Project Setup
This function prompts the user for two numbers and builds an array containing all integers between them. It leverages the readline module for user interaction and a for loop to populate an array based on whether the first number is larger or smaller, ensuring the array captures all values in the specified range.


# Prime Number Identifier

## Description
This is a script that helps you find prime numbers from a user-provided list of numbers.


## Project setup
This script helps you find prime numbers. Enter comma-separated numbers when prompted, and it will identify and display only the prime numbers from your list using an efficient algorithm and clear output.
